<p>Our goal is to explore the physics underlying the behaviour of complex fluids. We use cutting-edge numerical and experimental techniques to investigate the behaviour of viscoelastic and elasto-viscoplastic fluid flows in a variety of flow configurations. Recently, we have also started utilizing data-driven tools to model and predict near-wall turbulence in viscoelastic flows.</p>

<p>We have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics of complex fluids.</p>

<p>Updating soon. Stay put!</p>

<p><strong>Particle suspensions</strong>
Particle suspensions in elastoviscoplastic fluids: The study of particle suspensions in elastoviscoplastic (EVP) carrier fluids is inspired by a variety of industrial and scientific applications, such as hydraulic fracturing in the oil industry, the pumping of concrete in the construction industry, and sorting or separation of biological cells in microfluidic devices. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the interaction between particles and EVP fluids in the existing literature. To address this, we perform interface-resolved direct numerical simulations to study the collective dynamics of spherical particles suspended in a laminar pressure-driven EVP duct flow. In particular, we investigate the individual and combined effects of solid volume fraction, yield stress, inertia, elasticity, shear-thinning viscosity, and secondary flows on particle migration and formation of plug regions in the carrier fluid. We observed cross-streamline migration of particles depending on the elasticity of the carrier fluid: in suspensions with low elasticity, in the presence of inertia, particles tend to concentrate between the duct center and the walls, while accumulation of particles at the duct corners is observed when increasing the fluid elasticity. Furthermore, yield stress, shear-thinning viscosity, and secondary flows enhance the effect of elastic forces on pushing the particles toward the duct corners. Additionally, we observed the development of a moving plug at the duct center due to insufficient shear stress to yield the material. This plug region can be disrupted by particle-induced stresses in suspensions with high solid volume fractions but can be strengthened by increasing the yield stress of the EVP material.</p>

<p><strong>Contact angle hysterisis</strong>
We are also interested in trying to understand how roughness affects the physics of a two pair fluid when they are in contact with a solid and how this can be beneficial in understanding the dynamics of flow in a porous media filled with two Newtonian Fluids, one invading the other. Or in the case of Non-Newtonian Fluids we explore the effect of roughness on the movement of a droplet on a solid which would further help us in bettering the understanding of complex fluids in real life when in contact with a solid.</p>
